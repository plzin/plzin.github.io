Hopefully interested high school students could understand this post, but I think this might be something not everyone who has taken math on the university level has considered.","id":"polynomials"},{"title":"Mixed Boolean-Arithmetic (Part 4): Deobfuscation","date":"2023-04-24","macros":[{"b":"\\mathbf{b}"},{"v":"\\mathbf{v}"},{"x":"\\mathbf{x}"},{"Z":"\\mathbb{Z}"}],"summary":"We discuss the deobfuscation of linear MBA and how that corresponds to finding small vectors in the solution lattice of a linear system.

I explain why I find one of the often given high school \"proofs\" unsatisfactory and we try to formalize the real numbers. Noticing the difficulty, I explain the Cauchy sequence construction. After defining decimal notation, we can now actually prove 0.999... = 1. I discuss whether the Cauchy sequence definition is \"correct\". Finally, I explain the hyperreal numbers and we try to make sense of 0.999... = 1 there.","id":"non-standard-analysis"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
